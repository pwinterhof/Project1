### Mid-Project Retro:

#### Please take a moment to think about the questions and write down the answer before your scheduled appointment time.
#### For question 3 please refer to your project repo, directly in links or by specific line numbers and files.

##### What are the features of your MVP?

The ability to create a deck, deal cards, check for blackjack, make a bet, dealer logic, check who wins, and return money to the player

##### What aspects of your approach and attitude so far have been the hardest?

I've been most focused on trying to keep my code organized and simple.  In the past, I would just jump at a hw assignment or lab and would be able to finish it in general.  However, it was difficult to go back to it and remember what I did.  In this project, I'm planning on getting the back-end of my MVP finished and then going back and adding bonus features and doing the CSS/DOM part.  So, it will be much easier and I'll avoid a lot more mistakes by a more organized approach.  It's not necessary the hardest part but I have to remind myself to be conscious of it and move slowly.

##### What have you gotten done so far?

I have completed nearly all the functions for the back end of my MVP.  

Create deck: lines 38, 39, 44
Shuffle: 52, 
Deal: 81
Make bet: 72
Check for blackjack: 93
Compare winners and pay out bets: 120
Other functions: Hit, stay, re-deal, 

##### What steps are you going to take to make sure that your goals are accomplished by project presentation time?

I'm going to finish my mvp today.  Spend saturday adding on some bonus features, like insurance, split, double, and dealer hitting on a soft 7.  On sunday, I'll make it pretty.
